# SHSU_uRecipe-Group-Project
final project for my software engineering course 2024
The project was spearheaded by Aleksander Geiger, Kristoper Pounds, Nicholas Ray,
Carlos Rodriguez, Tyler Spice-Smith.

We were given a semester to plan, design and produce a working web application. We made uRecipe to be a place for all levels of experienced cooks to create, share and browse recipes. Some important key features are our security, ease of use and being app free. We all had limited knowledge on HTML, JSNode, and SQL lite going into this so it took a lot of learning. We also had to learn how to work as an effiecient team!
